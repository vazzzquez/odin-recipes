    <p>A staple on many menus and an Italian classic, the Negroni is punchy, bittersweet and the ideal dinnertime aperitif. Although many Italians will say that it's appropriate to drink any time of day!</p>
    <p>Combining equal parts of gin, vermouth and Campari, the Negroni is an iconic cocktail that will always be in style! Poured over ice and with a slice of orange to garnish, it's easy to see why it's one of the most popular cocktails not only in Italy, but around the world.</p>
