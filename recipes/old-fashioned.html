    <p>With an air of class and sophistication, the Old Fashioned cocktail is a classic that remains just as popular now as it did over 200 years ago. Mixing Bourbon Whiskey, bitters, sugar and a dash of water led to this dark and delicious cocktail.</p>
    <p>The origins of this classic cocktail are a little foggy, with so many people claiming they created it it's difficult to trust anyone! The most common story is that it was invented in the late 1800s. This was when new liqueurs became available to bartenders, resulting in new and improved whiskey cocktails.</p>
