    <h1>Daiquiri</h1>
    <img src="../images/daiquiri.jpg">
    <p>When you think of a Daiquiri you may think of clear blue skies over sandy Cuban beaches. While it may seem like it's a cocktail that's best-suited for a tropical holiday, the Daiquiri is actually the most-ordered rum cocktail in pubs and bars across the globe.</p>
    <p>This classic, popular cocktail, which remains a Cuban speciality, combines just 3 very simple ingredients, rum, citrus juice and sugar for the fresh flavour we all enjoy. Typically garnished with a lime slice too, the Daiquiri is one of the most well-balanced cocktails around.</p>
