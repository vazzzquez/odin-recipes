    <h1>Manhattan</h1>
    <img src="../images/manhattan.jpg">
    <p>The classic Manhattan cocktail has survived countless trends, outlasted prohibition and is now known as one of the greatest cocktails ever made. I think we can all agree it definitely deserves its spot amongst the world's most popular cocktails! Made with whiskey, sweet vermouth and bitters the Manhattan is the perfect after-dinner tipple.</p>
    <p>First mixed in 1870 at the Manhattan Club (who would've guessed?) by Jennie Jerome, the mother of Winston Churchill, the cocktail was a huge hit and has remained just as popular ever since. It's now widely available in bars, cafes and restaurants all over the world and is very highly regarded by both bartenders and patrons alike.</p>
